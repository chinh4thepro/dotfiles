## This is just a minor update from november's dots and includes the scripts I use,

#### Things I have installed:
#### `hyprland` as window manager
#### `wofi` as application launcher and powermenu
#### `waybar` as topbar
#### `dunst` for notifications
#### `brightnessctl` to control my brightness
#### `swww` as background manager
#### `nm-applet or network-manager-applet` for dealing with internet
#### `kitty` as my terminal emulator

#### Fonts that are being used are `FontAwesome`, and `Fantasque Sans Mono`.
